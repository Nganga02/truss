# This is the documentation for the implementation of the truss project
## Scope of the project
1. Implement the equations of truss 
1. Implement the animation for the behavior of the truss

The document captures the flow of how I implemented the project from start to finish

Equations of study:

1. ### The stress function
   $F(\lambda ) = A\sigma(\lambda)$


1. ### The stored energy function
   $W(\lambda) = \int_{1}^{\lambda} \sigma(\xi)\, d\xi$


1. ### Linear stress strain relationship
   $\sigma = E\epsilon$
